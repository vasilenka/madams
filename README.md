# Usage
### Setup the app
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal/console and run `npm install` or `yarn install` if you prefer using `yarn` to install all the project dependencies.

### Connecting to database
We are using mongodb atlas as development database, to get your own free cloud atlas, just go to [http://mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com "MongoDB Homepage").

After setting up your database, add new `nodemon.json` file on your root folder and copy the value in `nodemon.example.json` and add your database configuration value.

### Running the App
In your terminal, navigate to the the madams directory (if you are not in it already) and run the app using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. If everything's good, your app will running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000 "localhost:5000")

`npm run dev` will start a nodemon server where the server will automatically reload when there's changes in your code. You can run `npm start` or `yarn start` if you want to start server without `nodemon`.
